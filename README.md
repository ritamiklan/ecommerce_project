# Full-stack ecommerce website project

This is a project I decided to do as an independent study project.

I am following the tutorial of Bassir Jafarzadeh for building an e-commerce platform like Amazon.

My goal is to imlement a similar full-stack system, but to allow users to buy "suspended" coffee for others. So this project combines my interest for coffee and coding.
